	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature and technology don't have to exist at odds with each other. 
In fact, similar smart home tech that automates your thermostat or your garage door can extend outside the walls of your house,
 helping you make your own corner of nature thrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart garden and lawn care tech encompasses plant sensors, weather monitors, sprinkler systems and even robot lawn mowers. 
The diversity is fitting for the great outdoors, but it can also make it difficult to know where to start.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you understand your options, you can stem your plant killing ways with push notifications, you can save time with automation, 
 or you can simply collect data and monitor the conditions of your land. 
 The diversity of smart garden tech will prove beneficial instead of daunting once you find the tools to fit your needs.
